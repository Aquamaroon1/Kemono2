# TODOs

## Server

## Archiver
- Make dev file import work

## Client
### Webpack
- SASS uses its own module name resolution mechanism which differs from the current webpack setup. Specifically `config.resolve.alias` rules will not apply to filenames in `@use "";` expression.
- Figure out how to pass env variables to stylesheets.
- Figure out how to set up source maps for production.
### HTML/Templates
- Find a way to nest macro calls.
#### `user.html`
- AJAX search.

#### `import` pages
- consolidate them into a single page, since most of them are just placeholders for AJAX scripts.

### CSS
### JS
