  <h1>A statement from Kemono’s owner and administrator on content policy</h1>
  <p>
    It has been over seven months since the administrator of the late yiff.party announced the site’s closure. This was a serious blow to the paywall ripping scene, with the archives of thousands of creators disappearing overnight. However, not all hope was lost. A little-known site named Kemono had launched that January, starting as a small side project for a novice developer. Suddenly, thousands of people from all across the internet migrated to this strange new frontier, as the community tried their best to rebuild and recover. Of course, not all initially went as planned, as most of you know. But eventually, with the help of our volunteer developers and administrators, Kemono stabilized, and became the leading paywall archive, serving over 13,000 artists and over 25TB of content. However, our growth has led to many questions being asked about the future of the site - one of which being our content policy. A very vocal sect of the community has voiced their concerns over the archival of certain content; specifically, real life pornography, or colloquially referred to as “thots,” and reaction content, the creators of which take media such as anime and record their thoughts and opinions while watching it live. Several reasons have been given for why this is the case, and I would like to address each one in this note.
  </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul style="margin: 0;">
        <li>Kemono no longer bans any genre of content.</li>
        <li>All import/DNP restrictions have been removed.</li>
        <li>The purge list will be reviewed under heavy scrutiny from our administrators.</li>
        <li>The purge list, after review, will be repurposed to help classify different creators in order to aid in the implementation of a categorization/tagging feature to order to ease tensions between Kemono’s different communities.</li>
        <li>These new policies may be reviewed in the future if certain content is deemed to cause significant harm to the interests of the site for any reason.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>“Thot and reaction content uses up too much storage space.”</h2>
  <p>
    There is no evidence this is actually the case. Before yiff.party’s <a href="https://archive.is/87cGI">exclusion and deletion policy</a> was implemented (which would lower the amount of data in question even more,) <a href="https://archived.moe/t/thread/986532/">real life content made up less than a terabyte of content across Yiff’s entire 32TB database (about 2% in total.)</a> Statistics from yiff.party archivists indicate reaction content weighed less than 6GB after dedupe, which is not surprising considering it almost always consists of simple text and embeds. Storage is simply not an issue for these types of content. Yiff.party’s real life pornography purge did not have a noticeable effect on site performance. This is a negligible at best concern that I feel should be ignored in this case.
  </p>

  <h2>“Thot and reaction content is low quality.”</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://kemono.party/patreon/user/17357932">Hundreds of</a> <a href="https://kemono.party/patreon/user/30274814">fetish artists</a> <a href="https://kemono.party/patreon/user/41997780">on par with</a> <a href="https://kemono.party/patreon/user/12408400">the artistic skill of an 11-year-old</a> exist on Kemono without complaints, and yet thots and reactions don’t. I believe it is not the job of an archive to selectively discriminate based on quality, as the term is highly subjective. Freedom has been given to the userbase of Kemono to tune their experience to their own tastes - and a vocal minority of those users do not wish to afford that same freedom to a select few, despite themselves having preferences of a questionable nature to most.
  </p>

  <h2>“Thot and reaction content is not the focus of Kemono.”</h2>
  <p>
    Despite popular belief, Kemono was not intended to be a furry-based site. The “Kemono” name was chosen at random amongst a few others, taking a Japanese spin on the word “Yiff.” The site was actually intended for anime and hentai art, and I myself am not a furry, but an otaku. However, I’m okay with furry art, and welcome members of the the furry and all other communities to use the site freely. However, this welcoming attitude given to them has been drowned out by the highly vocal minority, whose statements have been propagated throughout all communities and led to the widespread belief that content not in line with the “furry” and “art” definition will be deleted. I fear this has already led to a slow cannibalization between Kemono’s different communities. Some argue Kemono is for porn only, and all SFW artists should be deleted. Some argue Kemono is only for art, while not realizing the exclusion of things like educational YouTube content. Some even jokingly suggest excluding hentai, without realizing that if every demand is caved to, certain communities may actually push for this to happen.
    <br>
    But even ignoring any notion of focus or niche, I do not believe the paywall ripping scene can afford to exclude content in its current state; Kemono is the only current option. For example, variation of niches in other groups like the booru scene only exist after over 16 years of development and growth. Compare this to our scene, which has only really existed in full force for about 6 years. In the future, it may be possible for more niche sites to exist, but for now, everything is more or less centralized by nature, and I believe restricting content could have detrimental effects to the scene as a whole. Other groups starting their own sites right now is unrealistic - everything is still highly experimental, the costs are high, and the audience is small. Attempts at niche paywall archivers like 3d3d.party have been made, but they almost always die within weeks. For those who see other communities as “invaders,” I’d encourage you to see the other sides’ point of view. If in an alternate world, the majority of Kemono users were consumers of thot porn or reactors and was still the only site of its kind, would it be fair to restrict all other types of content?
    <br>
    We can <em>not</em> afford to cave to mob demands of content deletion, and it is not fair to boot other groups when there are zero alternatives.
  </p>

  <p>There are a few other things I wish to address.</p>

  <h2>The original content policy</h2>
  <p>
    When Kemono was started, I originally took a hard stance against real life pornography, and that content was against the rules of the site. This was a major mistake on my part, and I apologize to those whose favorite creators were swept up in the various purges and bans. I was doing my best to keep yiff.party refugees happy by bending out of pressure from the community, while ignoring less vocal parts of it. Suffice to say, the situation since then has changed.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The “purge list”</h2>
  <p>
    I’ll be concise; this was done horribly, and I’m sorry. While I did indeed approve it, the people trusted to collect users were heavily biased, and attempted to include creators that did not fit the “real pornography” definition. Even after I confronted the team member about this, and the more egregious violations were resolved, the scope of the list is still overly broad, including SFW ASMR creators and creators he simply did not like.
  </p>

  <h2>The final verdict</h2>
  <p>
    Despite pressure from a vocal minority of Kemono users, I am making an executive decision to prevent the removal of any content that is not classified as illegal under United States law. The furry community will no longer have control over what content we host.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As always, thank you for supporting kemono.party, and I hope from here on out, all of Kemono’s communities can work together against the paywall.<br>
